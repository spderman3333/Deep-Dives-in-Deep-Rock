# Deep-Dives-in-Deep-Rock

A neat little program for sending deep dive information to a webhook on discord.

## Important
Set the url string on line 15 in main.py to whatever url your webhook is.

Set role_id (line 17) to the id of the role you want mentioned in discord.

## Other
You should probably fork it.

You are free to use this code as you please.

Thanks to *Hayden Moritz* for making [DRG api]([https://drgapi.com/ "Rock And Stone!").

This is one of my first working projects, I hope to make many more like this.
